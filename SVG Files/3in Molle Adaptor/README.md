## How to Use
1. Download the .SVG file from this repository.  
2. Import it into your laser cutter software (e.g., LightBurn, Glowforge, RDWorks).  
3. Adjust scaling if necessary (check the units!).  
4. Choose material and settings:  
   - Power: XX%  
   - Speed: XX mm/s

## Notes
You will need some chicago screw (or similar) hardware to secure the clasping effect design of the adaptor as well as potentially for what you connect them to.
May not be a 1-1 replica of the APADT series.
