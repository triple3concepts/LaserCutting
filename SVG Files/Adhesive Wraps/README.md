These files are designed to be used with adhesive backed cordura. The appeal of these wraps is it allows an alternative to painting or permanent color modification to items that you may not want to alter such as NODs, Scopes, etc. Other benefits can potentially include reduced IR signatures, reflection, etc based on the cordura or fabric used.

#### How do I make my own wraps?
The most common way is to use sheets of 3M 300LSE adhesive sheets combined with cordura fabric. Apply the two together and then laser cut the combined fabric. You can find sheets of adhesive with a simple google search and there is at lease one vendor who sells through Amazon. 
You can also buy premade adhesive cordura that is basically the same thing.
