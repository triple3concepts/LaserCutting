#### What Laser cutter do I use?
I use a [Roly Lasermatic XW 30w](https://rolyautomation.com/products/lasermatic-mk2-xw-with-610x390-work-area). It is a diode laser that is very beginner friendly and is capable of cutting various materials, including CURV tactical and Tegris thermoplastics as well as laminate cordura. 
#### What Laser software do I use?

#### What Sewing machine do i use?
Currently a Consew 206rb5 walking foot machine. If you are looking at sewing heavy duty materials and fabrics, you will need an industrial grade machine. There are a few other popular ones, Juki, etc.
